// BCCI Announced Test squad last Month for the tour of England as the team will play the WTC final against New Zealand in June as well as five Test matches
// against England in August-September, India and New Zealand are the top two teams and now they have to play the World Test Championship (WTC) final test
// match and the winning team will lift the inaugural World Test Championship (WTC) trophy.
// Rohit Sharma also known as Hitman Sharma and vice captain of Indian Cricket Team decided that he will play very aggressively and will hit maximum time 
// sixes or fours. Also taking singles and doubles India won the match with ease because of Hitman Sharma's efforts.
// But due to some technical issues, the records of his boundaries and singles and doubles got lost . Now Cricinfo, which maintains the records for each 
// player, wants to hire you as a developer if you are able to resolve this problem and give them the exact count of runs in every over.
// Cricinfo will give you an array of N overs, containing runs made in each over.
// For making your task easy, maximize the contiguous number of overs such that in every over different runs were made.
// If you are able to complete this task successfully, then congratulations you are hired.
