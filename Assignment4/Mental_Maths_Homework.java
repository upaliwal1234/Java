// Monuâ€™s Maths Teacher at school gave him some numbers today and she promised him a treat if he could find the greatest product that he can make using any
// three of those numbers. He is very weak in his studies and is really bad with numbers, help him find the answer if the numbers are given as an array A,
// of size N.
