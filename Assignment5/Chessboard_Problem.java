// Take as input N, a number. N represents the size of a chess board. Weâ€™ve a piece standing in top-left corner and it must reach the bottom-right corner.
// The piece moves as follows â€“
// a. In any cell, the piece moves like a knight. But out of the possible 8 moves for a knight, only the positive ones are valid 
// i.e. both row and column must increase in a move.
// b. On the walls (4 possible walls), the piece can move like a rook as well (in addition of knight moves).
// But, only the positive moves are allowed i.e. as a rook, piece can move any number of steps horizontally or vertically but in a manner, such that row or column must increase.
// c. On the diagonals (2 possible diagonals), the piece can move like a bishop as well (in addition to the knight and possibly rook moves).
// But, only the positive moves are allowed i.e. as a bishop, piece can move in a way such that row and column must increase.
// You are supposed to write the following functions
// a. Write a recursive function which prints all valid paths.
// b. Write a recursive function which returns the count of different distinct ways this board can be crossed. Print the value returned.
