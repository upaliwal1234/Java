// 141. Linked List Cycle
// Easy
// Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.
// There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. 
// Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.
// Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.
